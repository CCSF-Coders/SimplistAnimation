SimplistAnimation
=================

This is a base animation. Nothing happens but a counter counting, but we can use it to study the base game mechanic.

I added a spaceship image and a keyListener interface to SimplistAnimationTest .java to control that spaceship with the arrow keys
The Spacechip.java class calculates the position of the spaceship in the screen to be draw by the paint() method
The SpaceShip.png is an spaceship icon 80 x 80 pixels
